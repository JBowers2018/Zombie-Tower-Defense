# Zombie Tower Defense

This is a tower defense game made in Unity as part of my Game Development class during my last semester of college.

The full game is too big to store here, so what I have here are the scripts I wrote for it as well as the build. As part of my design, I wrote several different Controller scripts to handle the various components of the game, Instantiate being the first one to run.

To play the game, download the "Assignment 3" folder and run "Assignment 3.exe." Please do not remove anything from that folder, as the game may not run properly or at all.

If you'd like to see the full project, here's a Google Drive link:

Thanks, and have fun!
